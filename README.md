## Overview

This provides a demonstration of configuration as well as custom code to override the title attribute of a staff profile created with the Drupal profile module, so that the title will appear as the profile's First Name and Last Name instead of as "Staff Profile #1."

The entire Drupal configuration is provided, to [work with GitPod](https://github.com/ryan-l-robinson/Drupal-GitPod) for quick demonstration purposes. If you are only concerned with the custom code, it is in /web/modules/custom/profile_title.
